### Patch Changes

- 525ad50: Emergency patch — v0.5.1.

  v0.5.0 shipped `hookwarden` declaring a dependency on `@hookwarden/fix@0.0.1`
  but the `@hookwarden/fix` package was never published to npm. Every fresh
  `npx hookwarden scan .` since v0.5.0 has failed with HTTP 404 on
  `https://registry.npmjs.org/@hookwarden%2ffix`.

  Root cause: `@hookwarden/fix` was not in the changesets `fixed` group, so
  when v0.5.0's changeset bumped the CLI + engine + rules together, it
  silently skipped publishing `@hookwarden/fix`. The package was correctly
  configured for publish (`publishConfig: { access: 'public' }`, not
  `private`, built into `dist/`) — the publish pipeline just never targeted
  it.

  This patch:

  - Adds `@hookwarden/fix` to the `fixed` group in `.changeset/config.json`,
    so future bumps keep it in lockstep with the other publishable workspace
    packages. Prevents recurrence.
  - Bumps every package in the fixed group to v0.5.1 so the CLI's pinned
    `@hookwarden/fix` dep resolves against a version that's actually on the
    registry.

  No behavior changes vs. v0.5.0 — pure release-pipeline hygiene.
