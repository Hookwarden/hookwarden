Engine `Finding` gains optional `suppressed` payload (D-63: `{ source: "inline" | "ignore" | "baseline", pattern?, comment?, baselined_at? }`). Additive type bump; co-versioned across engine, rules, and CLI per D-05. CLI Phase 4 suppression annotator populates non-null values; engine emit sites set `suppressed: null` (or omit, since the field is optional).
