Fix `stripe/raw-body-misuse` false positive on the canonical Stripe happy-path pattern.

The engine's `body_as_bytes_or_buffer` evidence signal previously searched the handler's arrow function body for raw-body indicators. But `express.raw({ type: 'application/json' })` is registered as an **inline per-route middleware argument** — *outside* the arrow body — so the search missed it, even though the middleware was correctly resolved into `middleware_chain`.

Result: `stripe/raw-body-misuse` fired as a critical finding on every codebase that uses Stripe correctly with the path-scoped `express.raw` pattern. The PI-3 integration test had been written around this — `expect(stdout).toContain("verified")` masked the fact that exit code was 1 and a critical FP was being emitted alongside the verified badge.

**Fix:** Added `collectRawBodyMiddlewareEvidence` overlay in `packages/engine/src/model/build.ts` that follows the same pattern as the `sdkVerifyEvidence` overlay. When `middleware_chain` contains `express.raw` (qualified call) or `raw` (named import) AND the import source is `express` or `body-parser`, an evidence entry of kind `body_as_bytes_or_buffer` is appended. The `import_source` guard prevents false-negative matches from unrelated `raw` middleware on other routers.

**Test:** PI-3 strengthened — now asserts exit 0, `stripe/library-verified` present, `stripe/raw-body-misuse` absent, and `counts.active.critical == 0` on the happy-path fixture. Full suite: 234/234 pass.

Net effect for users: scanning a correct Stripe webhook handler that uses `express.raw` as a per-route middleware no longer emits a critical false positive. The `stripe/library-verified` (info, verified) finding still fires correctly to confirm the handler is verified.
